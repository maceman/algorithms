ASSIGNMENT: PA 1

AUTHOR: Mike Macey

DESCRIPTION: This program initializes two arrays, one of size n,
the other of size m. The size of m is the square root of n.
Insertion sort is used to insert random numbers into both arrays.
From there, binary search is implemented to find an element
within each array. The two arrays are merged once the smaller array
has no more room for insertion. An output file is produced that
analyzes the complexity of all three algorithms over both arrays.

INSTRUCTIONS: Program only needs to be executed to fully run.
Input sizes are 100, 10K, 500K and 1M. 

FILES: FileRunner.java
